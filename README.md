# TinderChain

## How to run
1. Run `yarn install` in the root dir
2. Run `yarn chain` in one terminal
3. Once the first terminal is dumping ETH network logs, run `yarn deploy` in the second terminal
4. When the second terminal finishes, run `yarn start` in that terminal to start the web app

## File structure
Solidity code lives in `packages/hardhat/contracts` and `packages/react-app` houses the FE code
